JWT Stands for JSON Web Token is a self-contained way of transmitting data between two parties in JSON format. It's commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

Authentication involves verifying a user's identity when accessing a resource or system, confirming their validity.

Following successful authentication, authorization determines the actions or resources the user can access, defining permissions and privileges.

Why Use Tokens?
Tokens play a key role in modern authorization mechanisms by validating and authorizing requests to access resources. They enhance security by avoiding the transmission of sensitive information like passwords with each request. Instead, a token is used for subsequent requests, reducing the risk of credential exposure.

They also ease the server load as they're self-contained and don't require constant database lookups for validation.

JWT Structure:
A JWT generally comprises three parts separated by dots:

Header: Contains metadata about the token type and the hashing algorithm used.
Payload (Claims): Carries the information transmitted, like user ID, permissions, roles, etc.
Signature: Generated by combining the encoded header and payload with a secret key, ensuring the token's integrity during transmission.

Here's a sample token:

eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJVc2VyIERldGFpbHMiLCJpc3MiOiJKV1QtUHJvamVjdCIsImVtYWlsIjoic2FyYS52ZW50cnVAZ21haWwuY29tIiwicm9sZSI6IkFETUlOIiwiaWF0IjoxNzA0NDkxMDcwLCJleHAiOjE3MDQ0OTQ2NzB9.PD5wLV79EQktJwKaew5iHeYJHIIYpWh29Knf26Sa4jo

How JWTs Function:
For authentication, after a user logs in, a JWT is generated and sent to the client. The client includes this token in subsequent requests to access protected resources. The server then validates the token for authentication and permissions.

Implementation:
To secure endpoints, extending the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter allows configuring which endpoints need to bypass the authentication which means users can access those services without performing the Authentication like user creation or password reset. Also, we can provide access to the endpoints for specific role users.

After generating a token, it's sent back to the client for storage. Cookies or local storage are commonly used to store tokens. Browsers automatically include cookies in subsequent requests, while localStorage stores tokens within the client-side storage.
